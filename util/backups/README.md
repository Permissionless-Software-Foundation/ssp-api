# Backups

The scripts in this folder are used to backup and restore an SSP data. The export.js script will create a JSON file containing all the Stores and Claims. The import.js will read in the JSON file and populate a fresh database with the entries.

## Creating a Backup
Make sure that ssp-api **is not** running. Execute the backup with this command:

- `node export.js`

## Restoring a Backup
Make sure that ssp-api **is not** running. Ensure the JSON file generated by `export.js` is in the same directory as `import.js`, and ensure you are starting with an empty database for ssp-api. Run the import script with:

- `node import.js`
